# ManagerX
Your Manager for paying the bills after a hangout.

When we go out on hangouts at a restaurant with a large group of friends, it's easy to loose track of who ordered what and how should we split the bill. To keep track of those cases, I created this app for my personal use.Started it as my first android project and added features as I learned new things.

Current Features : 

	- Create,Edit and update attendee list

	- Swipe between List of Orders for each item

	- Edit orders as you wish

	- Save an event for later access or export it to SD card as a txt file

	- Restore an older event , with all previous data saved

	- Save how much each person's bill was, how much they paid and how much they were due
