Intelligent Assistant for paying the bills after a hangout

Created it for my own use, as I needed it to help me share the bills properly.Started it as my first android project, so added features as I learned new things.

Current Features : 
	- Create,Edit and update attendee list
	- Swipe between List of Orders for each item
	- Edit orders as you wish
	- Save an event for later access or export it to SD card as a txt file
	- Restore an older event , with all previous data saved
